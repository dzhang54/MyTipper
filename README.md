## Notes

This app took me a really long time to implement. This is my very first app and I had to go though a lot of stack overlflow forums as well as a lot of the Apple developer libraries. For the most part, I spent a really long time trying to implement the settings page, and spent a lot of time trying to implement a storage function. I'd definitely still like to update this application as I get more and more knowledagble with XCode and Swift.
